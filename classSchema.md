### Schema for Aggregation Party

For your crosswalk (draft due 4/29), map your own schema to the class schema below. Include details on how you will normalize your data values (if necessary) to meet the requirements of the target schema. For instance, you may need to trim your creation dates back to only yyyy or replace personal name URIs with string values.  

For the aggregation party (5/6), you will bring 20 of your records transformed from your own schema to the class schema. Serialize your records in a single csv file (element names in the top row as a header, one record per row below). Separate repeated values within a single cell with semicolons.  

We will be trying out some of Viewshare's visualization tools, including the Map View, so I strongly encourage you to include geographic coordinates for any spatial data you may have.
